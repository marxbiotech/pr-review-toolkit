# PR Review and Document

Execute comprehensive PR review using pr-review-toolkit and post structured results as a PR comment.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- A comprehensive PR review needs to be documented on the PR
- A formal review record is required for a feature branch
- Review findings need to be visible directly on the PR for team reference

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get PR Number

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q '.number'
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, inform the user and stop.

### Step 2: Check Existing Review Comment (Cache-Aware)

```bash
EXISTING_CONTENT=$(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cache-read-comment.sh "$PR_NUMBER")
```

This uses the local cache if available, falling back to GitHub API on cache miss.

If content is returned:
- Extract metadata from `<!-- pr-review-metadata ... -->` block
- Note the current `review_round` and issues status

### Step 3: Execute PR Review

Launch the pr-review-toolkit with opus model using the Skill tool:

```
Skill: pr-review-toolkit:review-pr
Args: all
Model: opus
```

**Required agents (always run):**
- **code-reviewer** - General code quality and CLAUDE.md compliance
- **code-simplifier** - Code simplification opportunities
- **silent-failure-hunter** - Error handling and silent failure detection
- **type-design-analyzer** - Type design quality analysis
- **pr-test-analyzer** - Test coverage analysis
- **comment-analyzer** - Comment accuracy and maintainability

**Important:** All agents are mandatory for every review to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Step 4: Format Review Comment

Structure the review as a PR comment with hidden metadata and collapsible sections.

**Character Limit:** Keep total content under ~40K characters (GitHub limit is 65,536).

#### Metadata Block Format

The metadata block uses HTML comment syntax with a specific marker for identification:
- Opening: `<!-- pr-review-metadata` (marker on same line as opening)
- Content: JSON object with review state
- Closing: `-->` on its own line after the JSON

**Important:** The `find-review-comment.sh` script searches for `<!-- pr-review-metadata` to identify review comments. Do not modify this marker format.

#### Comment Template

```markdown
<!-- pr-review-metadata
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "skill": "pr-review-and-document",
  "review_round": 1,
  "created_at": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "updated_at": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "branch": "branch-name",
  "base": "main",
  "issues": {
    "critical": { "total": 0, "fixed": 0 },
    "important": { "total": 0, "fixed": 0 },
    "suggestions": { "total": 0, "fixed": 0 }
  },
  "agents_run": ["code-reviewer", "silent-failure-hunter", "type-design-analyzer", "pr-test-analyzer", "code-simplifier", "comment-analyzer"]
}
-->

### Step 5: Save Comment to Temp File

Write the formatted content to a temporary file:

```bash
TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp)
# Write content to $TEMP_FILE
```

### Step 6: Write Review Comment (Cache-Aware)

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cache-write-comment.sh "$TEMP_FILE" "$PR_NUMBER"
```

The script will:
- Update local cache (`.pr-review-cache/pr-{N}.json`)
- Sync to GitHub via `upsert-review-comment.sh`
- Return the comment URL

### Step 7: Cleanup and Verify

```bash
rm -f "$TEMP_FILE"
```

Confirm the comment was posted successfully by checking the returned URL.

## Status Indicators

Use consistent status indicators:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ✅ | Fixed / Resolved |
| ⏭️ | Deferred / Skipped intentionally |
| ⚠️ | Needs attention |
| 🔴 | Blocking / Critical |

## Multi-Round Reviews

When updating an existing review:

1. Increment `review_round` in metadata
2. Update `updated_at` timestamp
3. Update issue counts and statuses
4. Keep the same comment (GitHub tracks edit history)

Previous review content is preserved in GitHub's "edited" dropdown, providing full audit trail.

## Integration Notes

### Using with pr-review-toolkit

This skill wraps the `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` command and:
1. Forces opus model for comprehensive analysis
2. **Always runs all 6 review agents** (mandatory)
3. Formats output as structured PR comment
4. Posts directly to the PR

### Character Limit Handling

If review content exceeds ~40K characters:
1. Collapse more sections with `<details>`
2. Summarize verbose descriptions
3. Move detailed code examples to collapsed sections

### No PR Available

If the current branch has no open PR:
- Inform the user
- Suggest creating a PR first: `gh pr create`

## Validation Checklist

Before posting the review comment:

- [ ] PR number correctly identified
- [ ] All 6 review agents executed
- [ ] Metadata JSON is valid
- [ ] Issue counts match content
- [ ] Status indicators are consistent
- [ ] Content is under 40K characters
- [ ] Comment posted/updated successfully
